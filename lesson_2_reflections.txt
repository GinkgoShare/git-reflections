What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you neeed to do it?

When you initialize a git repository, the utility creates the necessary metadata needed to track its history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows a user to choose what specific contents of the working directory they would like to commit to the repository.



git commands learned in lesson 2:

	git init : turns an existing directory into a git repository

	git status : shows which files have changed since the last commit, shows the most recent commit

	git add : adds chosen files to the staging area prepping for a commit

	git commit -m "Commit message" | git commit :
